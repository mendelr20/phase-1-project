                <H2 id="h2">About this application:</H2>

                <h3 id="h3">Medication Errors are deadly, which means that even if it happens once it is 1 time to much. 
                    <br>Working in EMS, it is a very fast paced environment with a lot of pressure, a lot of adrenaline 
                    <br>rushing, and decisions made in seconds. 
                    <br>
                    <br> When a medication has to be administered, sometimes it is a matter of seconds to get the medication 
                    <br> in, as well as you need to be able to calculate the correct dosage in those seconds. 
                    <br>
                    <br>In Ems and as a paramedic specificity we carry very potent drugs with a very narrow therapeutic index,
                    <br>if a extra 0, missing a 0 or mistaking mcg for mg or g you can instantly kill a pt. 
                    <br>
                    <br>You can see why EMS is set up for Medication Errors.
                    <br>
                    <br>In comes this application with the goal of this application to get rid of medication errors, 
                    <br>by having a list of medications, their dosages for each use, and the ability to completely calculate 
                    <br>a medication starting with calculating the COH (concentration on hand), the patients age, weight, 
                    <br>method of administration, size of the administration set when it is applicable, time over which 
                    <br>it will be administered, condition it is being used for, as well as contraindications to the 
                    <br>administration of that specific drugs and special considerations. 
                    <br>
                    <br>I hope that this will help eliminate drug errors in EMS which are under reported
